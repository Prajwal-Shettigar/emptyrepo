>>>>>>create table Student( usn varchar(11) primary key,name varchar(20),age int not null);


2.Create table Student1 selecting USN, Name  from Student. 

>>>>>>create table student1 select usn,name from student;

3.Create table Student2 selecting USN, Name from Student, but rename them as st_USN, st_Name in new table.

>>>>>>create table student2 select usn as st_usn,name as st_name from student;

>>>>>>create table student_new select * from student;

5.Insert 5 records to Student table

>>>>>>insert into student values('4dm18cs029','prajwal',21),('4dm18cs031','prasad',22),
      ('4dm18cs010','ashwath',22),('4dm18cs017','kaushik',22),('4dm18cs053','sumanth',22);

6.Retrieve contents of all the three tables.
>>>>>>select * from student;
>>>>>>select * from student1;
>>>>>>select * from student2;

7.Create table Student3 selecting USN, Name from Student 

>>>>>>create table student3 select usn,name from student;

8.Create table Student4 selecting USN, Name from Student but rename them as st_USN, st_Name in new table. 

>>>>>>create table student4 select usn as st_usn,name as st_name from student;

9.Retrieve contents of Student3 and Student4 tables.

>>>>>>select * from student3;
>>>>>>select * from student4;

10.Insert all the records of Student3 to Student2. 

>>>>>>insert into student2 select * from student3;

11.Insert USN, Age values to the Student_new table from Student table of those students whose age is 21.

>>>>>>insert into student_new(usn,age) select usn,age from student where age=21;

>>>>>>insert into student values('4dm18cs001','sushmitha',21),('4dm18cs030','pranav',22),('4dm18cs028','pooja',22);

13.Retrieve all the contents of Student table 

>>>>>>select * from student;

14.Retrieve USN, Name of all Students from Student_new table 

>>>>>> select usn,name from student_new;

15.Retrieve USN and Name of all Students from Student table whose age is less than 23.
